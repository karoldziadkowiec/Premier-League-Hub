# Premier-League-Hub

The project listed is the Premier League Hub website for the 2023/2024 season. The main goal is to provide viewers with information about upcoming matches. The site presents precise dates and match results for each matchweek, including details of the participating teams in the Premier League competition. The season was divided into two rounds: fall and spring, with 19 games each. Thanks to this, users can follow the course of the season in its full time.

Technologies used in the project: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (using jQuery).

The main goal of the project is to learn ordered and unordered lists in practice, and to precisely link to elements in the current page. The project includes animations of scrolling to the selected element, which are provided by the jQuery library. A scroll up button has been added which also includes an animation of scrolling to the top.
